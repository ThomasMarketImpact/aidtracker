2. **OCHA Control** - OCHA to "control the spigot" on aid distribution
3. **Reduce Bureaucracy** - Eliminate "bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep"
4. **Accountability Mechanisms** - Track every dollar spent
5. **Agency Restructuring** - Individual UN agencies must "adapt, shrink, or die"
6. **Claimed Savings** - Administration claims $1.9 billion savings vs. old grant models

## Part 8: Critical Context - US UN Arrears (Ronny Patz Analysis)

**Source:** Ronny Patz, UN System Analyst & Expert in UN Financing (LinkedIn, Dec 30, 2025)

> "The USA owes more than $2 billion of assessed funding to the #UNbudget (regular plus peacekeeping) to now pledge $2 billion in UN humanitarian aid, pledges that it will likely not honor unless its demands are met, and an amount that is still massively less than what it has paid in previous years. I'm not saying it's nothing, but it's more show than substance until the funding has actually been disbursed."

### 8.1 US Assessed Contributions vs. Voluntary Contributions

| Type | Definition | US Obligation |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Assessed Contributions** | Mandatory dues all UN members must pay under UN Charter | ~$3 billion/year |
| **Voluntary Contributions** | Discretionary funding for humanitarian/development programs | $8-14 billion/year (historically) |

**Key Distinction:**
- The **$2 billion pledge** is for **voluntary humanitarian** funding via OCHA
- This is **separate from** the ~$3 billion in **mandatory assessed dues** the US owes

### 8.2 Current US Arrears (Unpaid Dues)

| Category | Amount Owed | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Regular Budget Arrears** | $1.5 billion | UN Budget Chief, Oct 2025 |
| **Peacekeeping Arrears** | $1.5-2.4 billion | State Dept, Pew Research |
| **TOTAL US ARREARS** | **$3.0-3.9 billion** | Multiple sources |

**Why arrears accumulate:**
- Congress caps US peacekeeping payment at **25%**, but UN assesses US at **26.15%**
- This creates automatic shortfalls every year
- US is the **largest debtor** to the UN

### 8.3 Detailed Arrears Breakdown

**Regular Budget (as of Jan 1, 2025):**
| Period | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-2001 | $171.4 million |
| 2001-2015 | $21.2 million |
| 2016 | $19.1 million |
| 2017 | $7.3 million |
| 2018-2022 | $4.3 million |
| 2023 | $10.4 million |
| 2024 | $434.6 million |
| **Total** | **$668.3 million** |

**Peacekeeping (as of Jan 1, 2025):**
| Period | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-2001 | $328 million |
| 2001-2024 | ~$1.18 billion |
| **Total** | **$1,509.7 million** |

### 8.4 Impact on UN Operations

- UN had **record $607 million borrowing** in 2024
- **Hiring freeze** instituted
- Limits on non-essential travel
- Peacekeeping missions ordered to **cut 15% of budgets**
- **25% reduction** in police/military personnel planned

### 8.5 The Irony: Pledging $2B While Owing $3B+

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| US unpaid assessed dues | **$3.0-3.9 billion** |
| New humanitarian pledge | **$2.0 billion** |
| Net US position | **Still in arrears** |

**Expert Assessment (Patz):**
- The $2B pledge is "more show than substance until funding has actually been disbursed"
- Pledge is conditional on UN meeting reform demands
- Amount is "massively less" than historical US humanitarian funding

### 8.6 Pledge vs. Disbursement Risk

| Factor | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| Conditional on UN reforms | High - "adapt or die" requirements |
| Congressional approval needed | Medium - rescissions already pulled $1B |
| Historical track record | Medium - US has withheld funds before |
| Administration priorities | High - proposed ending peacekeeping payments in FY2026 |

### 8.7 Recent Congressional Actions

| Date | Action | Amount |
|------|--------|--------|
| July 2025 | Rescissions package passed | -$1 billion UN funding |
| FY2026 Budget Request | CIO funding | -83% vs FY2025 |
| FY2026 Proposal | End peacekeeping payments | Full elimination |

## Part 9: Key Takeaways

### The Numbers

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 Pledge | Change |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| US Humanitarian Funding | $14.66B | $2B (new model) | **-86%** |
| Countries Receiving US Aid | 146 | 17 (initial) | **-88%** |
| US Share of Global | 33-38% | ~8-10% (projected) | **-70%** |

### Critical Context

1. **Not comparable directly**: The $2B is through a new pooled-fund model via OCHA, not the old bilateral grant system
2. **Additional funding possible**: Described as "initial anchor commitment" - more may follow
3. **Excludes major crises**: Afghanistan (23M in need), Yemen (21.6M in need), Gaza not covered
4. **Reform-contingent**: Continued funding depends on UN meeting "adapt or die" requirements

## Summary: The Complete Picture

### What the US is PLEDGING (New)
- **$2 billion** in voluntary humanitarian funding via OCHA pooled funds
- Conditional on UN reforms ("adapt or die")
- For 17 countries (excludes Afghanistan, Yemen, Palestine)
- Represents **86% reduction** from 2024 levels

### What the US OWES (Outstanding)
- **$1.5 billion** regular budget arrears
- **$1.5-2.4 billion** peacekeeping arrears
- **$3.0-3.9 billion TOTAL** unpaid mandatory dues
- US is the UN's **largest debtor**

### What the US USED TO PAY (Historical)
- **$14-17 billion/year** in voluntary humanitarian funding
- **~$3 billion/year** in assessed contributions
- **33-38%** of global humanitarian funding

### Bottom Line
The US is pledging $2B in new voluntary humanitarian funding while simultaneously:
1. Owing $3B+ in unpaid mandatory dues
2. Cutting 86% from historical voluntary funding levels
3. Making the pledge conditional on UN reforms
4. Proposing to eliminate peacekeeping payments entirely in FY2026

As Ronny Patz notes: **"It's more show than substance until the funding has actually been disbursed."**
